Great! You have a trained deep learning model, and you're ready to proceed with the deployment pipeline using Docker and Kubernetes. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you with each task:

### Task 1: AI Model Development

1.1 **Choose a Framework:**
   - Confirm the framework you used for training your model (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).

1.2 **Export Model:**
   - Export your trained model to a format that can be easily loaded by your chosen framework during inference (e.g., TensorFlow SavedModel format or ONNX format).

### Task 2: Web Service Creation

2.1 **Choose a Web Framework:**
   - Select a web framework to create a simple API. Flask (Python) or Gin (Go Lang) are good choices.

2.2 **Create API Endpoint:**
   - Create an API endpoint that accepts input data and returns predictions using your trained model. Your API should also log requests and results in a MySQL database.

2.3 **Database Connection:**
   - Connect your web service to a MySQL database to log prediction requests and results.

### Task 3: Containerization with Docker

3.1 **Write Dockerfile:**
   - Write a Dockerfile specifying the environment, dependencies, and how your application should run.
   - Include instructions to copy your model file (`model.h5`) and the web service code into the Docker image.
   - Install necessary dependencies and set up the working directory.

3.2 **Build Docker Image:**
   - Build a Docker image using the Dockerfile you created.

### Task 4: Deployment with Kubernetes

4.1 **Write Kubernetes Deployment Configuration:**
   - Write a Kubernetes Deployment YAML file specifying the deployment configuration for your Docker containers.
   - Define the number of replicas, container image, environment variables, and any other necessary configurations.

4.2 **Create Kubernetes Deployment:**
   - Use the `kubectl` command to apply your Kubernetes Deployment configuration and deploy your application.

### Task 5: Documentation

5.1 **Create README File:**
   - Provide a README file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run your model, web service, and Kubernetes deployment.
   - Include any scripts or commands required for deployment.

### Task 6: Bonus (Optional)

6.1 **Implement Basic Authentication:**
   - If you choose to implement authentication, add basic authentication to your API.

6.2 **Add Simple Front-end Interface:**
   - Optionally, create a simple front-end interface (e.g., using HTML/CSS and JavaScript) for users to interact with your model.

Remember to test each step of your deployment pipeline locally before moving to the next task. Once everything is working as expected, you can proceed with deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.
